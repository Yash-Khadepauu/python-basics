# üêç Python Foundations: A Self-Paced Learning Path

Welcome to the MunSociety's Python learning workshop. This guide is crafted to take you from absolute beginner to building your own basic Python applications.

**üìå Goal:** Build a strong foundation in Python ‚Äî understand the "why" behind the code, not just the "how". Learn at your own pace, revisit topics often, and build mini-projects to solidify your understanding.

## üß© Python Mini Projects

Once you‚Äôre comfortable with the basics, try your hand at these projects. Each folder contains a file with a brief algorithm or problem description ‚Äî your task is to write Python code that implements it.

### ‚úÖ Suggested Beginner Projects

1. **Distance Converter**
   Convert values between kilometers, meters, and centimeters using input() and functions.

2. **Digital Clock**
   Display the current time in HH\:MM\:SS format using the `datetime` module.

3. **Color Picker Simulator**
   Simulate selecting random colors from a predefined list. (Great practice for random module.)

4. **To-Do List (Console Version)**
   Add and remove tasks from a list, with options presented in a loop.

5. **Simple Calculator**
   Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

## üöÄ Getting Started with Projects

We‚Äôll use **Fork & Pull Request** to share your code and contribute to the MunSociety repository.

**Step 1: Fork the Repository**

* Go to the MunSociety Python Project Repo on GitHub.
* Click the **"Fork"** button to copy it to your own GitHub account.

**Step 2: Clone Your Fork**

```bash
git clone <your_forked_repository_url>
cd <repository_folder_name>
```

**Step 3: Work on Projects**

* Open the project folder (e.g., `Distance Converter`) in VS Code or another editor.
* Write your code in the `main.py` file or as specified.

**Step 4: Save and Push Changes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed the To-Do List project"
git push origin main
```

**Step 5: Create a Pull Request**

* Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
* Click **"Compare & pull request"**, write a summary, and submit.
